### New

The Opportunity API has been released for a public beta. This API handles information related to opportunities, including the opportunity, opportunity attachments, and opportunity fundraiser entities.
The initial release contains endpoints to retrieve these entities by ID and to manage custom fields. For more information, check out the [entity]({{ stache.config.opportunity_entity_reference }}) and [endpoint]({{ stache.config.portal_endpoints_opportunity }}) references.
