### Announcement: Changes for [Opportunity]({{ stache.config.portal_endpoints_opportunity }}) API

We implemented new operation ID values in the OpenApi (fka Swagger) definitions for all endpoints in the Opportunity API. Note that any existing code relying on these endpoints will continue to function, since all routes and parameters are unchanged. However, if you make use of client-side generated code and want to regenerate your client wrapper, compile-time errors in your code stemming from new operation ID values will arise and need to be addressed.

### New

Added the following endpoint:

<div class="table-responsive">
  <table class="table table-striped table-hover">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Operation</th>
       <th>Method</th>
        <th>Route</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr class="clickable-row" data-url="{{ stache.config.portal_endpoints_opportunity_document_create }}">
        <td>Document (Create)</td>
        <td>POST</td>
        <td>/documents</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

### Announcement: Changes Planned for [Constituent]({{ stache.config.portal_endpoints_constituent }}), [Fundraising (Beta)]({{ stache.config.portal_endpoints_fundraising }}), [Gift (Beta)]({{ stache.config.portal_endpoints_gift }}), and [Opportunity]({{ stache.config.portal_endpoints_opportunity }}) APIs

We will implement new operation ID values in the OpenApi (fka Swagger) definitions for several SKY APIs. This change will improve client-side tooling support for code generation by making these values more deterministic and friendlier across different languages. Going forward, we expect high stability of these values (meaning, we won’t need to change them again).

Note that any existing code that has been deployed will continue to function with no problems, since we are not changing any routes or parameters. If you make use of client-side generated code and want to regenerate your client wrapper, you’ll need to fix any compile-time errors in your code stemming from new method names.

## January
### 2018-01-24

#### New

Added the following endpoints:

<div class="table-responsive">
   <table class="table table-striped table-hover">
      <thead>
         <tr>
            <th>Operation</th>
            <th>Method</th>
            <th>Route</th>
         </tr>
      </thead>
         <tr class="clickable-row" data-url="{{ stache.config.portal_endpoints_opportunity_attachment_tags_get }}">
            <td>Attachment tags</td>
            <td>GET</td>
            <td>/attachmenttags</td>
         </tr>
      </tbody>
   </table>
</div>

#### Changed

We added the `date` property to the [attachment]({{ stache.config.opportunity_entity_reference }}#Attachment) entity.

## 2017

### 2017-12-01

#### Changed

The [Opportunity list endpoint]({{stache.config.portal_endpoints_opportunity_get_list}}) now includes an option to filter opportunities based on their associated constituents. The optional `constituent_id` query parameter, which can be specified multiple times to imply a logical OR, filters the results to only include opportunities associated with the specified constituent record IDs. For example, `&constituent_id=1242&constituent_id=385` filters the results to only include opportunities associated with two constituent records: "1242" and "385."

### 2017-05-10

#### Changed

We updated the [Opportunity (GET)]({{ stache.config.portal_endpoints_opportunity_get }}) endpoint to return the `date_added` and `date_modified` properties.

### 2017-04-27

#### Changed

We added the `linked_gifts` property to the [opportunity]({{ stache.config.opportunity_entity_reference }}#Opportunity) entity. This property is an array of identifiers for the gifts that are related to the opportunity.

### 2017-04-12

#### New

The Opportunity API has been released for a public beta. This API handles information related to opportunities, including the opportunity, opportunity attachments, and opportunity fundraiser entities.

The initial release contains endpoints to retrieve these entities by ID and to manage custom fields. For more information, check out the [entity]({{ stache.config.opportunity_entity_reference }}) and [endpoint]({{ stache.config.portal_endpoints_opportunity }}) references.
