# {{ name }}

Monitor this page to keep up with the [Opportunity API (Beta)]({{ stache.config.portal_endpoints_opportunity }}) latest changes and {{ stache.config.api_type_name }} service releases.

## 2017-11-27

### Changed

The [Opportunity list endpoint]({{stache.config.portal_endpoints_opportunity_get_list}}) now includes an option to filter opportunities based on their associated constituents. The optional `constituent_id` query parameter, which can be specified multiple times to imply a logical OR, filters the results to only include opportunities associated with the specified constituent record IDs. For example, `&constituent_id=1242&constituent_id=385` filters the results to only include opportunities associated with two constituent records: "1242" and "385."

## May 2017
### 2017-05-10

#### Changed

We updated the [Opportunity (GET)]({{ stache.config.portal_endpoints_opportunity_get }}) endpoint to return the `date_added` and `date_modified` properties.

## April 2017

### 2017-04-27

#### Changed

We added the `linked_gifts` property to the [opportunity]({{ stache.config.opportunity_entity_reference }}#Opportunity) entity. This property is an array of identifiers for the gifts that are related to the opportunity.

### 2017-04-12

#### New

The Opportunity API has been released for a public beta. This API handles information related to opportunities, including the opportunity, opportunity attachments, and opportunity fundraiser entities.

The initial release contains endpoints to retrieve these entities by ID and to manage custom fields. For more information, check out the [entity]({{ stache.config.opportunity_entity_reference }}) and [endpoint]({{ stache.config.portal_endpoints_opportunity }}) references.
