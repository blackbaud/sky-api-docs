### Search and research

Have you thoroughly searched for an answer before asking your question? Sharing your research helps everyone. Tell us what you found (on this site or elsewhere) and why it didn’t meet your needs. This demonstrates that you’ve taken the time to try to help yourself, it saves us from reiterating obvious answers, and above all, it helps you get a more specific and relevant answer!


### Be on-topic

The [{{ stache.config.api_type_name }} technical forum](#) is defined to support questions on the new {{ stache.config.product_name_short }} APIs as defined within this site.  It is not meant for classic Raiser's Edge API support or plug-ins. Please stick to the appropriate topics and avoid asking for opinions or open-ended discussion. If you’re looking for a different topic, it might be covered on another forum sit e.

### Be specific

If you give us details and context, it will increase your chances of receiving a useful, relevant answer.

### Keep an open mind

The answer to your question may not always be the one you wanted, but that doesn’t mean it is wrong. A conclusive answer isn’t always possible. When in doubt, ask people to cite their sources, or to explain how/where they learned something. Even if we don’t agree with you, or tell you exactly what you wanted to hear, remember: we’re just trying to help.
