After the user grants (or denies) your authorization request, we'll redirect the browser to the `redirect_uri` that you specified in the request (in the above example, we'll redirect the browser back to your application at _https://www.example.com/oauth2/callback_).

If the user granted your app permission, the URL fragment will contain the following fields:

<div class="table-responsive">
  <table class="table table-striped table-hover">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Field</th>

    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>access_token</td>
        <td>string</td>
        <td>An access token to be used when making calls to the {{ stache.config.api_type_name }}.  The access token should be provided in the standard `Authorization` header in the form of `Bearer token` (note the separating space).</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>token_type</td>
        <td>string</td>

        <td class="column-2">The value of the <code>state</code> parameter you supplied in the initial authorization request.</td>
      </tr>

        <td>string</td>
        <td>The ID of the specific Blackbaud customer (tenant) whose data can be accessed using the access token.  When the user grants permission to your application, they do so in the context of their organization.  The tokens we issue can only be used to access that customer's data.

You may store this value in your application along with the user's access token.</td>
      </tr>

If the user denied your permission request, the query string will contain the following parameters:
