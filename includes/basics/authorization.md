All endpoints within the {{ stache.config.api_type_name }} require user-authorization, so in addition to a <a href="#subscription" class="smooth-scroll">subscription key</a> you'll also need to supply an OAuth 2.0 access token to access a specific Blackbaud customer's data.  This token can be obtained through the <a href="{{ stache.config.guide_web_api_authorization }}" target="_blank">authorization process</a>, and should be included on every request as part of the `Authorization` header (see <a href="#request-headers" class="smooth-scroll">request headers</a>).

Note that the token is tied to the authenticated user's account and organization, which means that your application can only access data to which the authenticated user has permission.
