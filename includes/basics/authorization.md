All endpoints within the {{ stache.config.api_type_name }} require user-authorization, so in addition to a <a href="#subscription" class="smooth-scroll">subscription key</a> you'll also need to supply an OAuth 2.0 access token to access a specific Blackbaud customer's data.  This token can be obtained through the <a href="{{ stache.config.guide_web_api_authorization }}" target="_blank">authorization process</a>, and should be included on every request as part of the `Authorization` header (see <a href="#request-headers" class="smooth-scroll">request headers</a>).

<p class="alert alert-info"><strong><em>Note:</em></strong> The token should be considered an opaque value and is tied to the authenticated user's account and organization. This means that your application can only access data to which the authenticated user has permission.</p>
