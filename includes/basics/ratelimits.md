Calls to the {{ stache.config.api_type_name }} are subject to the rate limit associated with your API subscription (see <a href="#subscription" class="smooth-scroll">subscription</a>).

Rate limits help us to keep our backend servers from being overloaded with too many requests in a short period of time by limiting the number of calls you can make within that period.  When your rate limit is exceeded, you'll receive a `429 - Too Many Requests` response from the API, and the body of the response will indicate how long you must wait before making the next call (you can also inspect the `Retry-After` header which will contain the number of seconds to wait):
