Calls to the {{ stache.config.api_type_name }} are subject to the quota associated with your API subscription (see <a href="#subscription" class="smooth-scroll">subscription</a>).

Quotas allow us to enforce an appropriate level of API use over a broad period of time by limiting the number of calls you can make within that period.  When your quota is reached, you'll receive a `403 - Quota Exceeded` response from the API, and the body of the response will indicate how long you must wait before the quota period renews (you can also inspect the `Retry-After` header which will contain the number of seconds to wait):
