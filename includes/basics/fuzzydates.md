Fuzzy dates are found on entities with date-like properties where the complete date may be unknown. They are represented in the {{ stache.config.api_type_name }} as a JSON object with 3 fields for the year, month, and day components: `y`,`m`,`d`.

Fuzzy date fields generally allow the following formats:
- month, day, and year
- month and year
- year only

Some entities may support additional formats, so be sure to reference the specific documentation for an endpoint that accepts or returns a fuzzy date.

For example, the <a href="{{ stache.config.constituent_entity_reference }}#Constituent" target="_blank">constituent</a> entity `birthdate` field is a fuzzy date that supports "month and day" as well as the above formats.  In the below sample JSON representation, only the `y` property of the fuzzy date is shown which indicates that only the year value is known:

{
  "id": "280",
  "type": "individual",
  "lookup_id": "96",
  "inactive": false,
  "name": "Dr. Robert C. Hernandez",
  "last": "Hernandez",

  "nickname": "Bob",
  "title": "Dr.",
  "gender": "male",
  "birthdate": {
    "y": 1961
  }
}</code></pre>

The following example shows a partial collection of <a href="{{ stache.config.constituent_entity_reference }}#Note" target="_blank">notes</a> for a constituent. The `date` property is a fuzzy date, and in the first note the value represented is June, 2007.
